## Calculator Application

### Overview
This project implements a basic calculator application using Python's 'tkinter' library. It offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing simple arithmetic operations.

### Features
- **GUI Interface**: The calculator provides a simple, user-friendly interface for performing calculations.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage calculations, and parentheses.
- **Input Handling**: Users can input numeric values, decimals, and operators through button clicks.
- **Clear Functionality**: A 'C' button allows users to clear the input and start fresh.
- **Evaluation**: The 'equals' button evaluates the input expression and displays the result.

### Structure
- **Entry Display**: At the top of the interface, there's an entry field displaying the input equation and the calculated result.
- **Buttons**: Various buttons for numbers (0-9), decimal point, basic operators (+, -, *, /), parentheses, percentage, clear (C), and equals (=) are provided for user interaction.

### Usage
1. **Input**: Click on the respective buttons to input numbers, operators, and special characters.
2. **Clear**: Press 'C' to clear the input field.
3. **Calculation**: Click '=' to calculate the result based on the input equation.
4. **Error Handling**: The calculator handles simple arithmetic expressions and evaluates them. Division by zero or invalid input might not be handled explicitly in this basic implementation.

### How to Run
- Execute the Python script containing the calculator code.
- The calculator GUI will appear, allowing users to perform calculations through the provided interface.

### Disclaimer
- **Limited Functionality**: This calculator is a basic implementation and might not handle complex equations or error cases extensively. It's designed for simple arithmetic calculations.
